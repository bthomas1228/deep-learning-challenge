# deep-learning-challenge

The Neural Network Final Report was completed in word given that images were requested. This is attached to the homework submission in Bootcamp spot. 

The rest of the completed homework is saved in the repo linked. Please find the following files in the Deep Learning Challenge directory:

1) AlphabetSoupCharity_PreProcessing.ipynb (Steps 1 and 2) - open in Jupyter Notebook to review the python code
2) AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb (Step 3) - open in Jupyter Notebook to review the python code
3) AlphabetSoupCharity.h5 - initial model
4) AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 - optimized model
5) model.weights.h5 - saved weights captured every 5 epochs
6) Visualizations folder - copies of the visualizations included in the Neural Network Report

I used the Activities in Module 21 to guide my python scripting. I used Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to execute my python code for the models. I used tensorflow.org/tutorials for guidance on saving model to h5 format. Tensorflow, numpy and pandas were used as modules. 

Note, I saved weights at every 5 epochs but was unable to use the saved weights in running subsequent models.
