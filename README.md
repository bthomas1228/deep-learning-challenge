# deep-learning-challenge

The completed homework is saved in the repo linked. Please find the following files in the Deep Learning Challenge directory:

1) AlphabetSoupCharity_PreProcessing.ipynb (Steps 1 and 2) - open in Jupyter Notebook to review the python code
2) AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb (Step 3) - open in Jupyter Notebook to review the python code
3) AlphabetSoupCharity.h5 - initial model
4) AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5 - optimized model
5) model.weights.h5 - saved weights captured every 5 epochs
6) Neural Network Final Report (Part 4)
7) Visualizations folder - copies of the visualizations included in the Neural Network Report

I used the Activities in Module 21 to guide my python scripting. I used Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to execute my python code for the models. I used tensorflow.org/tutorials for guidance on saving model to h5 format. Tensorflow, numpy and pandas were used as modules. 

Note, I saved weights at every 5 epochs but was unable to use the saved weights in running subsequent models.
